1. Have gitbash with node and npm installed.
2. Have new directory, inside that directory create a js file. Let's call it index.js for this example. 
3. inside gitbash, open up that directory and do npm init to initialize npm. 
4. once that's done, do npm install express to get express running. 
5. inside the js file you'll need to require express, this is easiest by googling npm express module, it'll show example.
6. now to run your server, use gitbash in the directory and type node index.js and it'll run. 
7. if you want your server to be able to refresh without stopping and starting it, use npm to install nodemon. 
8. nodemon can be initialized after its been installed anywhere, doesnt have to be installed on every project i believe. 98 percent sure.
